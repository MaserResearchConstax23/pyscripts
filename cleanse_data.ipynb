    "### What this does\n",
    "This script loads a csv database of astronomical objects, which potentially has duplicates. It assumes that ra and dec are in the ICRS reference frame. The script helps you remove duplicates by finding objects that are close to each other, and labeling them potential duplicates. Then, it searches NED for the two objects' names, and if the name match is successful, assumes the objects are duplicates, and allows you to choose one to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the name match is unsuccessful, then it allows the user to decide if the two potential duplicates are in fact duplicates, while presenting some data from a NED search based on location and search radius. The user has the option to choose to keep either object or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the new dataset is saved.\n",
    "### What this does not do\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is intended to be a final database processing step after other methds of finding and removing duplicates have been applied. If there is a way to be sure that two objects are duplicates based on similar names, then use those methods before employing this script. Ideally, you will not have to use this script to sift through more than a hundred potential duplicates, as it can be tedius."
